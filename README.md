# Machine_learning_exercise
This is a coursera online course from Andrew Ng (ex1 to ex5)
Relevant key points for each exercise is listed below for future convenience

-Ex1:
  -Application of gradient descent in linear regression
  -Feature scaling for large data.
  
-Ex2:
  -Application of gradient descent in logistic regression with regulization
  
-Ex3 to Ex4:
  -Muti-class classification using Neural Network to regconize hand-written digits.
  -Backpropogation algorithm to find the parameters in the Neural Network is implemented.
  
-Ex5:
  -Design and diagnose machine learning system with the cross validation set
  -High bias or high variance.
  -Learning curves (Error vs the number of data set)
  -Error vs the value of regulation parameter lambda
  -Error vs the degree of hypothsis function
